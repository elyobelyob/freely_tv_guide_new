Alan creates an intimate peaceful space with a water feature, soft planting and parasol trees to create a quiet spot for reflection, while Bruce Kenneth builds a bespoke bench for Sybil to sit and remember her husband. Elsewhere, Danny Clarke visits the Barbican, where gardeners have transformed this urban landscape into a haven of greenery",
